We are pleased to bring you the ninth event of the Docklands.LJC; a group
within the main London Java Community that focuses on the developer community
in and around Docklands on the second Tuesday of each month. Our speakers this
month are Andy Ben-Dyke and Graeme Seaton.

<h2>Andy Ben-Dyke - Big Data, Java and Microservices - tales from the trench</h2>

Having had 8 years of Big Data Agile development experience, I thought working
on an IoT project using microservices would be straightforward.  There’s
nothing new under the sun, right?  After a few weeks of learning buzzwords and
acronyms, I could make a reasonable stab of explaining the difference between
Ansible and Docker (as a trivial example).  However, we’re now a couple of
months into the project, and I want to share the success stories and horror
stories with the audience.

<h2>Graeme Seaton - Applying Big Data</h2>

A great deal of time and energy is spent on Big Data initiatives. But the question remains, what are the drivers behind these initiatives and how do you approach using all of that data?  I would like to share some thoughts about the application of Big Data.

<b>Andy Ben-Dyke</b> is VP Engineering, IoT Analyics, Teredata Labs

Andy was one of the founding members of RainStor and a driving force behind the
original data management technology before becoming the Product Architect in
2006, and then the CTO in 2007.  The RainStor Big Data retention platform was
acquired by Teradata late 2014.  Since joining Teradata, Andy now heads up the
IoT Analytics team, tasked with building a Big Data micro-service architecture
for work-load management.  

Andy holds both a first class Masters degree in engineering and a PhD in
parallel and distributed computing from the University of Birmingham. He worked
in Japan for two years for Mitsubishi Electric, supporting and extending the
HP-UX kernel in the Pacific. He then spent 5 years working for DERA (Defence
Evaluation and Research Agency), quickly becoming a Principal Scientist within
the Parallel and Distributed Simulation group. During this time, Andy helped
develop the core IP that led to the creation of RainStor Inc., as well as
managing a range of long-term projects with a total value exceeding $10M,
spanning multiple organizations.
