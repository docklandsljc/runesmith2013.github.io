We are pleased to bring you the next event of the Docklands.LJC; a group within the main London Java Community that focuses on the developer community in and around Docklands each month.

Our speakers this month are John Matthew Holt, founder and CTO of Waratek and Abraham Marin-Perez, one of the leaders of the London Java Community.
They're both engaging and experienced speakers, so attendance is highly recommended.

John Matthew Holt -  Advances in Java Security.
-------------------------------------------------

In this presentation John Matthew will look at the problems faced in securing both new and legacy Java applications and how adding security to the runtime environment provides fast, accurate protection for code you have written yourself and third party code. John Matthew will look at the Struts 2 vulnerability, the challenges in protecting against Deserialization attacks and he will look forward to the problems that lie ahead with Java 9


Abraham Marin-Perez - Breaking Down Your Build: Architectural Patterns For A More Efficient Build Pipeline

-------------------------------------------------

Do you find constantly rebuilding things that don’t need rebuilding? If yes, this talk is for you. The way your codebase is structured impacts what you need to rebuild after each commit, therefore, the codebase needs to be re-architectured with the build pipeline in mind. Sometimes you’ll have many responsibilities packed in one module, so you rebuild all of them every time you change one. Or maybe you have a multi-tiered application and adding a feature implies modifying (and rebuilding) all tiers, with cascading effects. In this talk we’ll go over scenarios like this and others, showing how the code can be rewritten in a way that minimises unnecessary rebuilds. In the end, you’ll be equipped with a number of techniques that will help you manage your build pipeline.
