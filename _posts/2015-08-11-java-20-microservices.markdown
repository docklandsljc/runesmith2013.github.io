We are pleased to bring you the second event of the Docklands.LJC: a group
within the main London Java Community that will be focusing on the developer
community in and around Docklands, with the Twitter tag <a
href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dljcjug">#dljcjug</a>

The Docklands.LJC will meet on the second Tuesday of each month. At this event we
are delighted to have two excellent speakers coming to talk:

<h2>Steve Elliott – Java at 20 and Where we are Going</h2>

This talk will look back at where Java has come from over the last two decades
and where it is going in the future. It will provide a high level overview of
the Java release cycle, the different versions and updates and look at the
future challenges and how Java will evolve going forwards, including some of
the things that may be in Java 9 such as Jigsaw, the <code>sun.*</code>
changes, the G1 garbage collector, VarHandles and future projects such as
Valhalla and Panama.

<h2>Daniel Bryant – The Seven Deadly Sins of Microservices</h2>

All is not completely rosy in microservice-land. It is often a sign of an architectural approach’s maturity that in addition to the emergence of well-established principles and practices, that anti-patterns also begin to be identified and classified. In this talk we introduce seven deadly sins that if left unchecked could easily ruin your next microservices project...

This talk will take a tour of some of the nastiest anti-patterns in
microservices, giving you the tools to not only avoid but also slay these
demons before they tie up your project in their own special brand of hell.
Topics covered include:

* Lust - embracing the latest and greatest technology without evaluating the
* Gluttony - using excessive communication protocols
* Greed - trying to have too many systems
* Sloth - composing services in a lazy fashion, which ultimately leads to the creation of a “Distributed Monolith” operational impact incurred by these choices
* Wrath - failing to deal with the inevitable bad things that occur within a distributed system
* Envy - introducing inappropriate intimacy within services by creating a shared domain model
* Pride - selfishly ignoring the new requirements for testing
