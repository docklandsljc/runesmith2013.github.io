We are pleased to bring you the fourth event of the Docklands.LJC; a group
within the main London Java Community that focuses on the developer community
in and around Docklands that meets on the second Tuesday of each month <a
href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dljcjug">#dljcjug</a>. Our speakers this
month are David Brimley and David Garry.

<h2>David Brimley - Distributed Java Systems in Minutes with Hazelcast</h2>

Do you want to have quick access to a Java Map that can store terabytes of
data? How about if we make the Map partitioned across multiple JVM for fault
tolerance and scalability? We'll also make it in-memory so access is fast.

In this talk we'll look at how you can use familiar data structures and
services such as Maps, Sets, Lists, Queues and Topics in a distributed and
highly scalable manner. We'll be using Hazelcast, which is an open-source,
Apache 2 licensed, in-memory data grid. Hazelcast has a very shallow learning
curve, we'll have a distributed system running in minutes. You'll find that
the API is a piece of cake. It is regular Java Collections and Concurrency API,
but distributed. Now all your data is stored in memory you'll also discover
how to run various distributed compute operations over it, such as Query,
Aggregations and Map Reduce.

<h2>David Garry - Creating Java REST servers from Swagger API definitions</h2>

<a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a> is a simple but powerful representation
of RESTful APIs.  This talk will give an introduction to API creation using the
<a href="http://editor.swagger.io/">Swagger Editor</a>.

Using this API David will show how to generate a REST service in Java, using <a
href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen">swagger-codegen</a> to
create template Java REST servers with technologies such as Jersey, JAXB and
Jackson.
