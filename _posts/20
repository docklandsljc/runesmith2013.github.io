We are pleased to bring you the fifteenth event of the Docklands.LJC; a group within the main London Java Community that focuses on the developer community in and around Docklands on the 2nd Tuesday of each month.
Our speakers this month are Neil Bartlett and Phil Aston. 

As the spaces are limited, places will be preferentially allocated to those who have attended previously and first-timers; those with a low attendance record may be removed. 

** Please note **
Your full name is required in order to attend. 
If your username is not your full name, please add it when registering, otherwise you will be REMOVED from the event.

<h2>Neil Bartlett - Java 9, OSGi and The Future of Modularity</h2>

In this talk we will look at the differences between micro-services and monolith architectures and their relative benefits and disadvantages. We will look at design patterns which will allow us to utilize these different strategies as a deployment concern without significant changes to the business logic.

We will look at how micro-service architecture can be implemented under low latency constraints of 10 - 100 micro-second latencies, in Java in particular, and how these strategies reduce the impact of serializing data and logging.

<h2>Stephen Colebourne - Strata, the new Open Source Library for Market Risk</h2>

Strata is the new Open Source library for market risk from OpenGamma, written in Java 8. It follows the many of the design principles of Joda-Time and JSR-310, bringing easy-to-use and high quality open source to the domain of quantitative finance and market risk. In this talk Stephen will show how the library allows you to price financial instruments like interest rate swaps and options, demonstrating the key elements of the library including curves, conventions and holiday calendars. So if you work in finance, or are interested in what a well-designed Java 8 library looks like, do come along and see how open source can change finance.
