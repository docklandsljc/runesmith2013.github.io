We are pleased to bring you the seventh event of the Docklands.LJC; a group
within the main London Java Community that focuses on the developer community
in and around Docklands on the second Tuesday of each month. Our speakers this
month are Alex Blewitt and Simon Ritter.

<h2>Alex Blewitt - Modular Java applications with OSGi</h2>

OSGi has been part of the Java landscape since JSR 8 was proposed in 1999 and
is an invisible component of many application servers and tools. As well as
providing a modular partitioning of Java applications, the dynamism allows
(micro)services to come and go and be dynamically wired up.

This talk will introduce the problems associated with modularity in general,
and the choices that OSGi made in bringing modularisation to the Java runtime.
We'll also look ahead and ask how OSGi and Jigsaw will evolve in the future.

<h2>Simon Ritter - Project Jigsaw in JDK 9: Modularity Comes To Java</h2>

Project Jigsaw will bring modularity to the Java platform; something that will
enable better security, performance and flexibility for deployment of
applications. This talk will look at the fundamentals of how modularity in Java
will work. Developers will need to understand that these changes go
significantly further than just separating the standard class libraries into a
number of discrete units. 

This talk will explain the impact project Jigsaw will have on developers in
terms of building their applications, as well as helping them to understand how
things like encapsulation will change in JDK 9.

Azul Systems. Simon has been in the IT business since 1984 and holds a Bachelor
of Science degree in Physics fromBrunel University in the U.K.

Originally working in the area of UNIX development for AT&T UNIX System Labs
and then Novell, Simon moved to Sun in 1996. At this time, he started working
with Java technology and has spent time working both in Java development and
consultancy. Having moved to Oracle as part of the Sun acquisition he focused
on developer outreach for the core Java platform, Java for client applications
and embedded Java. Now at Azul he continues to help people understand Java as
well as Azul's JVM technologies and products.
