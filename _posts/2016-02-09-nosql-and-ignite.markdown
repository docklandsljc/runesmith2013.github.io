We are pleased to bring you the eighth event of the Docklands.LJC; a group
within the main London Java Community that focuses on the developer community
in and around Docklands on the second Tuesday of each month. Our speakers this
month are Akmal Chaudhri and Christos Erotocritou.

<h2>Akmal Chaudhri - Selecting a NoSQL database from a menu of over 200 products</h2>

Today, there are thought to be over 200 commercial and open source NoSQL
database products. Often, these products are divided into four broad
categories: key-value stores, column stores, document stores and graph stores.
Increasingly, some products are combining several of these categories together
into what are called multi-model database systems. 

Whilst the market for NoSQL database systems today is still very small and
thought to be around 2% of the SQL market, the technology has attracted
interest from organizations looking to solve new business problems. However,
since it is still an emerging technology, careful consideration is required in
finding the relevant developer skills and choosing the right product.

This presentation will discuss these issues in greater detail. In particular,
it will focus on some of the leading NoSQL database products and discuss their
architectures and suitability for different problems. Java code examples will
be used to demonstrate Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations for
several leading NoSQL database products.

<h2>Christos Erotocritou - Introducing Apache Ignite</h2>

Apache Ignite is a high-performance, integrated and distributed in-memory
platform for computing and transacting on large-scale data sets in real-time,
orders of magnitude faster than possible with traditional disk-based or flash
technologies.

During this session youâ€™ll learn about the Apache Ignite project and how it is
used to solve some of the most demanding scalability and performance
challenges. We will cover a few typical use cases and work through some
examples.
