We are pleased to bring you the eleventh event of the Docklands.LJC; a group
within the main London Java Community that focuses on the developer community
in and around Docklands on the second Tuesday of each month. Our speakers this
month are Richard Warburton and Raoul-Gabriel Urma.

<h2>Richard Warburton and Raoul-Gabriel Urma - Java Generics: Past, Present and Future</h2>

Generics are one of the most complex features of Java. They are often poorly
understood and lead to confusing errors. Unfortunately, it won’t get easier.
Java 10, release planned for 2018, extends Generics. It’s now time to
understand generics or risk being left behind. 

We start by stepping back into the halcyon days of 2004 and explain why
generics were introduced in the first place back. We also explain why Java’s
implementation is unique compared to similar features in other programming
languages. 

Then we travel to the present to explaining how to make effective use of
Generics. We then explore various entertaining code examples and puzzlers of
how Generics are used today. 

Finally, this talk sheds light on the planned changes in Java 10 with practical
code examples and related ideas from other programming languages. If you ever
wanted to understand the buzz around value types or declaration site variance
now is your chance!
