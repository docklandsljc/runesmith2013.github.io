We are pleased to bring you the sixth and last event of 2015 of the
Docklands.LJC; a group within the main London Java Community that focuses on
the developer community in and around Docklands on the second Tuesday of each
month.

Our speaker this month is Steve Elliott; we are also collecting for 
<a href="http://www.crisis.org.uk/">Crisis at Christmas</a>
for this Christmas-themed event. üéÑ

Please note the location for this event as it is in a different location from
the previous one. 

<h2>Steve Elliott - The Ghosts of Java Past, Present and Yet to Come</h2>

The world was a very different place 20 years ago when Java first appeared. That
environment shaped many aspects of Java (JVM, networking, security, types,
concurrency etc) and despite a lot of evolution since there are still areas of
Java that reflect those beginnings.

This session will cover the evolution of how Java came to be what it is today
including some lesser known history. We will also look at the current roadmap of
Java going forwards. üëª‚òïÔ∏è

<h2>Alex Blewitt - Docklands.LJC Christmas Quiz</h2>

Christmas is coming, and to celebrate six months of Docklands.LJC meetups, we
will be having a post-talk Christmas Quiz. How much Java do you remember? Can
you name the previous talks? What, in a nutshell, is private protected access?
At the very least it will be a fun way to round out the year, and afterwards
drinks may be involved. üçª 

<h2>Crisis at Christmas</h2>

Crisis at Christmas is a charity that provides homeless Londoners with a
Christmas - not only a roof over their heads and hot meals, but also essential
services (such as doctors and dentists) that homeless people often have no
means of accessing. The LJC has been involved with Crisis for many years, and
members work as IT and computing support volunteers, as well as in the general
body of volunteers at the centres.

This year, Docklands.LJC is holding a special Christmas event to raise money
for Crisis. If you can afford to make a donation, please do. The money raised
will all be used by Crisis to directly help people who need it, especially at
this time of year. Some of London's homeless people are among the UK's most
vulnerable, and Christmas can be a very isolating and lonely time for them.

You can donate here: <a href="https://community.crisis.org.uk/reserve-a-place-general-donate">https://community.crisis.org.uk/reserve-a-place-general-donate</a> (or on the night). More information about <a href="http://christmas.crisis.org.uk/">Crisis at Christmas</a> can be found at the <a href="http://www.aimarfoundation.org/ccsignup/">Aimar Foundation</a>. 

<h2>Bio</h2>
