We are pleased to bring you news of the inaugural event of the Docklands.LJC: a group within the main London Java Community that will be focusing on the developer community in and around Docklands, with the Twitter tag 
<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dljcjug">#dljcjug</a></a>

The Docklands.LJC will meet on the second Tuesday of each month. At this opening  event we are delighted to have two excellent speakers coming to talk:

<h2>Stephen Colebourne - OpenGamma, a modern Java 8 based open-source toolkit for market risk</h2>

An Open Source toolkit for market risk? Yes! <a
href="http://www.opengamma.com">OpenGamma</a> provides open source software for
market risk, as a leading provider of OTC market structure solutions.

This talk will cover our soon-to-be-released next-generation toolkit,
engineered for ease of use and performance. Written in Java 8, it provides key
components for market risk application development, from time-series and
schedules to market data and reporting, for a range of asset classes.

Come along to this talk to learn more about OpenGamma, how we build our
software, and how we make best use of Java 8 in a modern software stack.

<h2>Simon Maple - Is your profiler speaking the same language as you?</h2>

Profilers are absolute beasts. And profilers might prove useful to pinpoint the
performance issues in your Java applications.

By using profilers, developers are fortunate to find the root cause of an issue
at hand. However, it requires effort to actually comprehend the data collected
by the profiler. Due to the inherent complexity of the data, one has to
understand how this data is collected. And thus understand how the profiler
actually works.

During this talk we will go through the classic profiler features. What is a
hotspot? What is the difference between sampling and instrumentation from the
profiler point of view? What are the problems with either of those methods?
What is the time budget of the application? And more!

I will also showcase a new kid on the block among the profiling tools: XRebel.
This tool provides insight into application behaviour and permits the
developers to discover application level issues.
